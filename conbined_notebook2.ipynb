    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) is the fastest-growing language in computer programming. Learning [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) is a great choice because [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Widely-adopted in the digital humanities and data science\n",
    "* Regarded as an easy-to-learn language\n",
    "* Flexible, having wide support for working with numerical and textual data \n",
    "* A skill desired by employers in academic, non-profit, and private sectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The second most-popular language for digital humanities and data science work is [R](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#r). We plan to create additional support for learning [R](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#r) soon. If you are interested in helping develop open educational resources for [R](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#r)\n",
    "\n",
    "The skills you'll learn in *Python Basics* 1-5 are general-purpose [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) skills, applicable for any of the text analysis notebooks that you may explore later. They are also widely applicable to many other kinds of tasks in [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) beyond text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Making Mistakes is Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every programmer at every skill level gets errors in their code. Making mistakes is how we all learn to program. Programming is a little like solving a puzzle where the goal is to get the desired outcome through a series of attempts. You won't solve the puzzle if you're afraid to test if the pieces match. An error message will not break your computer. Remember, you can always reload a notebook if it stops working properly or you misplace an important piece of code. Under the edit menu, there is an option to undo changes. (Alternatively, you can use **command z** on Mac and **control z** on Windows.) To learn any skill, you need to be willing to play and experiment. Programming is no different.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expressions and Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest form of Python programming is an [expression](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#expression) using an [operator](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#operator). An [expression](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#expression) is a simple mathematical statement like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1 + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The [operator](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#operator) in this case is `+`, sometimes called \"plus\" or \"addition\". Try this operation in the code box below. Remember to click the \"Run\" button or press Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or shift + return (OS X) on your keyboard to run the code."

    "\n",
    "All [expressions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#expression) evaluate to a single value. In the above examples, our [expressions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#expression) evaluated to single numerical value. Numerical values come in two basic forms:\n",

    "* [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float) (or floating-point number)\n",
    "\n",
    "An [integer](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer), what we sometimes call a \"whole number\", is a number without a decimal point that can be positive or negative. When a value uses a decimal, it is called a [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float) or floating-point number. Two numbers that are mathematically equivalent could be in two different data types. For example, mathematically 5 is equal to 5.0, yet the former is an [integer](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer) while the latter is a [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) can also help us manipulate text. A snippet of text in Python is called a [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string). A [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string) can be written with single or double quotes. A [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string) can use letters, spaces, line breaks, and numbers. So 5 is an [integer](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer), 5.0 is a [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float), but '5' and '5.0' are [strings](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string). A [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string) can also be blank, such as ''.\n",

    "|Text|string| 'Hello world', '1700 butterflies', '', '1823'|\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between each of these data types may seem unimportant, but [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) treats each one differently. For example, we can ask [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) whether an [integer](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer) is equal to a [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float), but we cannot ask whether a [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string) is equal to an [integer](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer) or a [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float).\n",

We wrote programs that executed line-by-line, starting at the top and running to the bottom.

We can control when (or if) code gets executed with [flow control statements](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#flow-control-statement). If a program is a set of steps for accomplishing a task, then [flow control statements](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#flow-control-statement) help the program decide the next action.\n",

In this lesson, we will learn about two additional data types: [lists](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#list) and [dictionaries](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#dictionary). [Lists](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#list) and [dictionaries](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#dictionary) help us store many values inside a single [variable](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#variable).

    "* [Lists](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#list) and [dictionaries](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#dictionary) only require a single [assignment state](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#assignment-statement)\n",

    "\n",
    "The fundamental difference between a [list](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#list) and a [dictionary](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#dictionary) is that a [list](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#list) stores items in sequential order (starting from 0) while a [dictionary](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#dictionary) stores items in [key/value pairs](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#key-value-pair). When we want to retrieve an item in a list, we use an [index number](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#index-number) or a set of [index numbers](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#index-number) called a [slice](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#slice) as a reference. When we want to retrieve an item from a [dictionary](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#dictionary), we supply a [key](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#key-value-pair) that returns the [value](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#key-value-pair) (or set of values) associated with that [key](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#key-value-pair). Each of these approaches can be beneficial depending on what kind of data we are working with (and what we intend to do with the data)."

If the value is found, it returns the [index number](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#index-number) for the first item with that value.

We have seen that the items of a [list](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#list) are stored in a strictly-ordered fashion, starting from item 0. In a [dictionary](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#dictionary), each [value](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#key-value-pair) is stored in relation to a descriptive [key](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#key-value-pair) forming a [key/value pair](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#key-value-pair). Technically, as of [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) 3.7 (June 2018), [dictionaries](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#dictionary) are also ordered by insertion. In practice, however, the most useful aspect of a [dictionary](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#dictionary) is the ability to supply a [key](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#key-value-pair) and receive a [value](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#key-value-pair) without reference to [indices](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#index-number).
