    "## Gesture Controlled Flappy Bird Project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview:\n",
    "This project creates a gesture-controlled version of the classic **Flappy Bird** game using **Pygame** for game rendering, **OpenCV** for accessing webcam input, and **MediaPipe** for detecting hand gestures. The player controls the bird using **thumbs-up** and **thumbs-down** gestures to make the bird jump or fall, respectively, while avoiding obstacles (pipes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps Involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Libraries**:\n",
    "   - **OpenCV (cv2)**: Used to capture video input from the webcam and convert image formats.\n",
    "   - **MediaPipe (mp)**: Provides hand tracking and gesture recognition.\n",
    "   - **Pygame**: Used for creating the game interface, rendering the bird, pipes, and handling game mechanics.\n",
    "   - **Sys and Random**: System-related operations and generating random numbers for pipe positioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initializing the Game**:\n",
    "   - Pygame is initialized, and the window size is set to **640x480** pixels.\n",
    "   - Colors like **white**, **black**, **green**, and **red** are defined for easy reference.\n",
    "   - The bird's starting position, size, gravity, and speed parameters are set.\n",
    "   - Pipe dimensions and speed are defined, with pipes appearing randomly from the top and bottom of the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **MediaPipe for Hand Tracking**:\n",
    "   - The **MediaPipe Hands** solution is initialized to track hand landmarks in real-time from webcam input.\n",
    "   - Functions like `is_thumbs_up` and `is_thumbs_down` are used to determine if the player is showing a thumbs-up or thumbs-down gesture, controlling the bird's vertical movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Game Mechanics**:\n",
    "   - **Bird Movement**: The bird's vertical position changes based on gravity or the player's gesture. A thumbs-up gesture makes the bird jump, while a thumbs-down gesture makes it fall.\n",
    "   - **Pipes and Collision Detection**: Pipes are generated at random heights, and the bird must fly between them to avoid collisions. If the bird collides with a pipe or the screen borders, the game resets.\n",
    "   - **Score System**: The player's score increases each time the bird successfully passes between pipes. The score and the highest score are displayed at the top of the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Gesture Detection with MediaPipe**:\n",
    "   - The game uses real-time hand gesture detection to control the bird's movement:\n",
    "     - **Thumbs Up**: The bird jumps upwards.\n",
    "     - **Thumbs Down**: The bird falls faster than normal gravity.\n",
    "   - Hand landmarks are drawn on the video feed for visual feedback during the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Game Interface**:\n",
    "   - The bird is rendered as an image, and pipes are represented by rectangles.\n",
    "   - A \"Play\" button is shown at the beginning of the game to start, and a \"Replay\" button is shown when the game ends, allowing the player to restart the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Score Display and Sounds**:\n",
    "   - The current score and highest score are displayed on the screen.\n",
    "   - Sound effects are played when passing through pipes, achieving a high score, or colliding with an obstacle.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Blurred Background**:\n",
    "   - A background effect is created by blurring the webcam feed to create a smooth background while displaying the game elements over it.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Saving and Loading High Scores**:\n",
    "   - The game saves the highest score to a file (`highest_score.txt`) and loads it at the start of each game session. This ensures that the highest score is preserved across multiple games.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Game Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start the Game**:\n",
    "   - The player starts by clicking the \"Play\" button rendered on the screen.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Gesture Control**:\n",
    "   - The webcam captures video input, and MediaPipe tracks the player’s hand gestures.\n",
    "   - Showing a **thumbs-up** gesture makes the bird jump, while a **thumbs-down** gesture makes the bird fall faster.\n",
    "   - The bird also falls naturally due to gravity when no gesture is detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoiding Obstacles**:\n",
    "   - The player must control the bird’s flight through gaps between randomly positioned pipes.\n",
    "   - Colliding with a pipe or flying off the screen ends the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scoring**:\n",
    "   - The player earns points by successfully navigating between the pipes. If the player beats their previous high score, it is saved and displayed during future sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Game Over and Replay**:\n",
    "   - Upon game over, a \"Replay\" button is displayed, allowing the player to start over. The game resets, and the bird and pipes return to their initial positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pygame**: Handles the game window, bird and pipe rendering, and game logic.\n",
    "- **OpenCV**: Captures the webcam feed, converts color formats, and displays the hand gesture video feed in a separate window.\n",
    "- **MediaPipe**: Tracks hand landmarks and detects thumb gestures, allowing for gesture-based bird control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage:\n",
    "1. Install necessary libraries like **Pygame**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**.\n",
    "2. Provide the paths for:\n",
    "   - A **bird image** (`bird.png`) for rendering the bird.\n",
    "   - Sound effects (e.g., crash, pass, wow sounds).\n",
    "3. Run the script and use your webcam to control the bird with hand gestures.\n",
    "4. Avoid obstacles by using **thumbs-up** to jump and **thumbs-down** to fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible Extensions:\n",
    "- Add more gestures for additional control (e.g., fist to pause the game).\n",
    "- Introduce different difficulty levels with faster pipe movement.\n",
    "- Implement multiplayer support by recognizing multiple hand gestures simultaneously.\n"
